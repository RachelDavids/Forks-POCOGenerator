# This file is used by Gendarme to maintain exclusion items that

# Project-level suppressions either have no target or are given
# a specific target and scoped to a namespace, type, member, etc.
#
#
# Alternatively, certain rules will recognise the matching FxCop suppression
# Suppressions can also be made in source where appropriate.
#
# Notes:
#   R = rule name
#   A = Applies to given assembly
#   T = Applies to specified type
#   M = Applies to fully qualified method.

This the second time I rewrite this project from the ground up, Hopefully it will be the last.

Main changes:
- Memory footprint significantly reduced.
- Added support of choosing which types of database objects to generate: Tables, Views, Stored Procedures, Functions, TVPs.
- Added MySQL. I tested on 5.7 but it should be good for 8 too.
- Removed command line support and replaced it with a dll. The dll can be added as reference to other projects.

What's ahead:
- Support DbContext
- Support EF Core
